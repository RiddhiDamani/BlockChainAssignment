# BlockChainAssignment

This project has been developed under the guidance of Dr. Clark Elliott for the course CSC435 - Distributed Systems 1 at DePaul University.

The code has been added to Git for keeping track of its versions and to showcase projects developed by me as a part of my portfolio. This code is solely my work with inspiration from Dr . Elliott's Utility codes and references provided to all students during the coursework. This project should not be copied by other students as they will risk plagirism consequences.
